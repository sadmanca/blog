BA Group has thus contributed to the success of thousands of noteworthy projects, including: residential, office, mixed-use, entertainment, retail, sports, education, health care, resort, recreation, parking, transit and industrial land uses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The organization consists of approximately 90 engineers, urban planners and administrative staff, many of whom are alums of co-op programs from Canadian universities, including the University of Toronto\u2019s PEY program. As a PEY student at BA Group, you will be part of a class of approximately 12 co-op students and can expect to work in collaboration with numerous recent graduates and engineers-in-training.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For the 2025-2026 work term, we are looking to hire 1-2 motivated, responsible individuals with the ability to work both independently and collaboratively as part of small-to-medium sized groups. Candidates will preferably have completed a significant portion of a Civil Engineering, Engineering Science or Industrial Engineering degree and have demonstrated a strong interest in Transportation Engineering and Planning.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <br/>\n  <strong>\n   Structure of a typical 12 to 16-month PEY co-op term\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is standard for PEY students at BA Group to rotate from working primarily with of the company\u2019s core departments to a different one every 4 to 6 months. The full PEY work term is therefore divided into 3 sub-terms. This exposure to all facets of the organization allows students to gain a wide variety of skills and develop an informed opinion regarding which area of expertise they may wish to pursue at the start of their career. The different departments in which a PEY student can be expected to work, as well as brief descriptions of the tasks associated with each, are listed below:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <em>\n    Modelling, Simulation &amp; Data Analytics\n   </em>\n   \u2013 development and calibration of traffic, transit and pedestrian simulation models using industry-standard software tools (Vissim, VisWalk, Visum, Aimsun, etc.), analysis and optimization of transportation systems, coding (Python, SQL, MATLAB, VBA etc.) of scripts to efficiently process model outputs and perform analysis of public transit and private vehicle travel time and origin-destination data\n   <em>\n   </em>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <em>\n    Analysis &amp; Planning\n   </em>\n   \u2013 traffic operations impact assessment using deterministic software analysis tools (Synchro, Vistro, InterCalc, etc.), development of trip generation, trip distribution and traffic assignment forecasts associated with various types and scales of proposed development projects, manipulation of geodatabases using ArcGIS, report writing and preparation\n   <em>\n   </em>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   <em>\n    Design\n   </em>\n   \u2013 design of transportation facilities including intersections, road segments, surface parking lots, loading areas, underground parking garages, etc. using AutoCAD, review of site plan design drawings and preparation of vehicle movement diagrams using AutoTrack\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  Note that, based on field of study and areas of interest or expertise, it is not unusual for students to spend up to 8 months working in one specific department, while dedicating less time to the other two. For example, Industrial Engineering students will usually tend to spend most of their PEY term with the Modelling, Simulation &amp; Data Analytics group, while Civil Engineering students with a strong CAD background will usually spend most of their term with the Design group.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <br/>\n  <strong>\n   Job Requirements\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Preferred candidates for this position will ideally possess:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u2022 Some familiarity with transportation modelling and traffic operations impact assessment software (Vissim, VisWalk, Synchro, Vistro, SimTraffic, InterCalc, Aimsun, EMME, etc.), technical drawing software (AutoCAD, AutoTrack), and geospatial data analysis software (ArcGIS, QGIS).\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u2022 Extensive experience with Microsoft Office software tools (Excel, Word, PowerPoint and Access).\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u2022 The ability to code using the Python, SQL, MATLAB, and/or VBA programming languages.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u2022 Some familiarity with database management systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u2022 Strong written, oral and interpersonal communication skills.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u2022 The ability to work effectively in a team environment, as well as individually.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u2022 An interest in transportation systems engineering and planning demonstrated via course work, projects, research internships, prior co-op terms, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you for your interest in a PEY position at BA Group.

Ensuring effective engagement helps to advance policies, regulations and services, and provides for a coordinated approach to achieve results that are representative of all interests. ECCC is also relied upon to provide science-based environmental information and services so that Canadians may make informed decisions relating to their health and safety.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  There are few major environmental issues for which Canada can find causes or solutions solely within its borders. For this reason, ECCC must engage not only at home but also work with international partners to develop effective solutions to global environmental challenges. The Department seeks to be flexible in order to respond to these challenges and changing circumstances.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Environment and Climate Change Canada is the lead federal department for a wide range of environmental issues. The department addresses these issues through various actions including the implementation of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change; engaging with our strategic partners including provinces, territories and Indigenous peoples; monitoring; science-based research; policy and regulatory development; and, through the enforcement of environmental laws. The department's programs focus on minimizing threats to Canadians and their environment from pollution; equipping Canadians to make informed decisions on weather, water and climate conditions; and conserving and restoring Canada's natural environment.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  The department's program focus reflects the interdependence between environmental sustainability and economic well-being.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Under the Department of the Environment Act, the powers, duties and functions of the Minister of Environment and Climate Change extend to matters such as:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The preservation and enhancement of the quality of the natural environment, including water, air and soil quality, and the coordination of the relevant policies and programs of the Government of Canada\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Renewable resources, including migratory birds and other non-domestic flora and fauna\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Meteorology; and\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The enforcement of rules and regulations\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  The department delivers its mandate through other acts and regulations, such as the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999), the pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries Act, the Federal Sustainable Development Act, the Species at Risk Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, the Canada Wildlife Act, and the Wild Animal and Plant Protection and Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  The department works closely with the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and Parks Canada \u2013 its ministerial portfolio partners \u2013 to achieve many common goals. In addition, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change has secondary or shared responsibility for delivering on other federal departments\u2019 mandates, including the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act (Transport Canada, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, and Natural Resources Canada), the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act (Natural Resources Canada), and the Emergency Management Act (Public Safety Canada).\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Please visit our website at:\n  <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n",

Designs have become more complex due to the decreased size of process node technology and to the increase in the number of logic blocks hence the high demand for Digital Design Verification Engineers.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  The candidate will be involved in verifying current and next generation Backplane Ethernet, PCIe, USB 3/4, and/or MIPI CPHY/DPHY SERDES products. The position offers an excellent opportunity to work with digital and mixed signal design engineers accountable for delivering high-end mixed-signal designs.

CCI focuses its activities on the markets it understands best, while constantly striving to expand its knowledge base and network of relationships in order to participate in new markets.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  CCI\u2019s natural gas activities include the ownership of physical reserves, physical and financial trading, leasing of storage and transport capacity, and transacting with producers and consumers. CCI\u2019s U.S. Natural Gas business consistently ranks among the top marketers of natural gas in the U.S. transacting on approximately 100 pipelines and over 60 storage facilities to create a geographically diverse portfolio of natural gas assets. CCI\u2019s natural gas storage leases comprise one of the largest independent storage portfolios in North America.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, CCI conducts business from offices located around the world including Calgary, Canada; Houston, Texas; New York, New York; Geneva, Switzerland; London, United Kingdom; and Singapore.

These all fluctuate on a daily basis and can result in price changes across the futures curve. Using our fundamental and price data warehouse, build visualization tools to process data and view relationships in supply and demand data.\u00a0 Interact with traders to determine which relationships have significant market impacts.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Weather is a large driver of price fluctuations in the natural gas market.\u00a0 It can have an effect on both supply and demand components.\u00a0 The historical data sets associated with weather are also very large.\u00a0 Analyze historical weather data and their relationships to natural gas fundamentals across time and regions.\u00a0 Build visualization tools to view those relationships.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  One key feature in the natural gas market is the existence of seasonality in the term structure of the futures curve.\u00a0 As a result, many seasonal relationships occur in trading patterns.\u00a0 Analyze historical relationships between storage and market pricing to find correlations in market activity.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Electricity markets are becoming an important driver of demand for natural gas markets. Forecasting electricity demand from natural gas is becoming increasingly challenging with the proliferation of renewable generation sources (wind, solar) in combination with traditional weather volatility. Additionally, fuel substitution potential exists between natural gas and coal at different price levels in various regions. Using proprietary information explore various forecasting techniques to improve electricity demand forecasting.\n </p>\n</div>\n",

We specialize in leveraging skillsets drawn from the world of commodities trading to both high-grade existing trading capabilities as well as extend those same capabilities to other parts of the value chain (producer, processor and marketer). We are currently focused on expanding our business in Oil &amp; Gas, Power and Agriculture.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  <strong>\n   What You'll be Doing:\n  </strong>\n  <br/>\n  You will spend your time helping our customers make better commercial decisions using advanced analytics tools such as Python, R, SQL and Javascript. You will use these tools to help build market supply and demand models, integrating both free and paid alternative data sources as well as run stochastic simulations and option valuation models. You may also help Qi build out a software suite that helps our customers do the same in an automated fashion. You spend a part of your day, every day, reading market research and specialized price reporting agency reports across the global energy supply chain to develop an intuition on how such news impacts the commodities markets and its implications to our customer's commercial decisions.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  <strong>\n   Why Work with Us?\n  </strong>\n  <br/>\n  We are nerds who love learning every day. Whether it's reading the latest in market fundamentals research, learning about new products and markets, learning new technologies or trying to apply cutting edge research to everyday business problems, we will support you in your learning journey. If you come to work with Quantim Intelligence, you will learn directly from industry experts with decades of experience in analytics, trading, risk, finance, and the energy markets. You will gain hands-on experience using advanced analytics to help customers solve their most consequential problems, especially around the energy transition.\n  <br/>\n  We are\n  <strong>\n   not\n  </strong>\n  a PowerPoint company. Our outputs are advanced mathematical models and strategic guidance on how to apply them. We want to apply your numerical modeling skills to actual business problems.
